Description: This is a prototype of a website that allows users to report contrustion sites that create traffi. It is a frontend only website which can be hosted locally by the user. All files are supposed to be installed to ensure proper use. We did not include backend as it was a prototype and due to time restraints, technical difficulties and resources.
